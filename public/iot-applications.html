    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      My name is Muneesh Khurana and I am pursuing Software Engineering from Chitkara University. My age is 19 years old and my hobies are playing cricket, watching movies and reading books. My aim is to become a Software Developer.
      The units I have studied untill now are:
      <ul>
       <li>Introduction to Programming</li>
       <li>Computer Systems</li>
       <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
       <li>Engineering Physics</li>
       <li>Robotics Project</li>
       <li>Data Information & Management</li>
       <li>Data Capture technologies</li>
       <li>Object Oriented Development</li>
       <li>Embedded System Development</li>
       <li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
       <li>Engineering in Society</li>
       <li>Sustainable Design</li>
      </ul>
     </p>
    <h2>Activity 1: IoT Apps</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
    <b>SUMMARY</b>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
     IoT Applications are sevices or softwares that are connected with the internet that provide real-time data through connected devices.
     They work without human intervention and provide accurate data depending upon the environmental factors.
     The IoT applications are useful in Home automation, environment monitering and supply chain management system.
     The main features of Iot Applications are:
     <ul>
      <li>Real Time connectivity</li>
      <li>Data Analyzation</li>
      <li>Decision making</li>
      <li>Safety</li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Activity 2: Smart Buildings</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
      <b>SUMMARY</b>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
     Smart Buildings are the self-capable building that can monitor conditions and take decisions.
     They are smart enough to tackle any problem and provide solutions to the existing problems without much human involvement.
     Their maintenance should be low cost and are energy efficients. Their approach should be eco-friendly and implement many technologies such as rain water harvesting, solar panel integrated grid system etc.
      The main features of Smart Buildings are:
   <ul>
   <li>Real Time connectivity</li>
   <li>High Security and Reliability</li>
   <li>Self-sustainable</li>
   <li>Minimal error in false case scenario</li>
   <li>Low-cost maintenance</li>
   </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Activity 3: Control Interface</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">
      <b>SUMMARY</b>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
   Control Interace are the dashboard that can be used by the users to monitor or view different parameters.
   They should be designed in more user-friendly way that provide security to the backup data as well. 
   The Control Interface are useful in many scenarios like Home automation, weather monitering and supply chain management system.
    In home automation, the control interface can be made for registered and non-registered user and different features can be provided and the different features can be provided such as entry notification to the registred users.
    For unregistered users, an alert system can be activitated after failing to recognise the face.
     The parts needed in making Control Interface are:
   <ul>
   <li>Stable Internet Connection</li>
   <li>Sensors for collecting data</li>
   <li>GUI dashboard</li>
   <li>Micro-processor/controller boards like Arduino, Raspberry pi etc. </li>
   </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>List of IoT Applications</h3>
